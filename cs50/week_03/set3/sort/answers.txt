sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Very slow on random and reversed but n-fast on sorted 

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: computation time is the fastest and identical for all the cases. Merge sort is inerently faster and also there it is 'insensible' to the kind of order of the data received

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Equally slow in all three cases (random, sorted, reversed)
